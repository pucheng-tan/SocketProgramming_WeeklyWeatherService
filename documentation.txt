----------------------Brief Introduction----------------------
The purpose of this assignment is to implement several servers and a client
for a simple weekly weather service, in C. 

----------------------Design----------------------
The weather summary is hard coded in an array. For the convenience of testing, 
the weather summary given to each day are:
    Monday: 1 degree
    Tuesday: 2 degree
    Wednesday: 3 degree
    Thursday: 4 degree
    Friday: 5 degree
    Saturday 6 degree
    Sunday 7 degree

----------------------Files----------------------
1. Makefile
2. client.c

3. server.c
   The port number was set on line 18 to be 33300, but you can change it
   to any idle port number between 30000 and 40000.

4. proxy2.c
   The proxy server works as a 'client' when connecting to the real server by 
   TCP, and works as a 'server' when connecting to the client by TCP. 
   It follows the steps:
      - Receive request from the client
      - Send request to the server
      - Hear back from the server
      - Respond to the client
   The port number was set on line 18 to be 38500, but you can change it
   to any idle port number between 30000 and 40000.

   When receiving the request 'all', the proxy make a sequence of seven response with
   an added heading for each summary giving the name of the corresponding day of the week.

5. talker.c

6. listener.c
    The port number was set on line 16 to be 39500, but you can change it
    to any idle port number between 30000 and 40000.
   
7. proxy3.c
   The proxy server uses TCP to communicate with the client, and UDP to communicate
   with the UDP-based server. It follows the steps:
      - Receive request from the client
      - Send request to the server
      - Hear back from the server
      - Respond to the client
   The port number was set on line 18 to be 39600, but you can change it
   to any idle port number between 30000 and 40000.

   When receiving the request 'all', the proxy make a sequence of seven response with
   an added heading for each summary giving the name of the corresponding day of the week.

----------------------Quality Assurance Strategy----------------------
- For any non-valid inputs, "Enter the day of a week" will prompt again.
  Non-valid arguments will be detected on the client side, without sending
  to the server.
- All valid arguments were tested 

----------------------Testing----------------------
    This part is showing the program is working, but can also be used as examples of 
    how to run the program.

In the proxy test, 'server' indicates the proxy server
is acting as a server connecting to the client. 'client'
indicates the proxy server is acting as a client connecting
to the server
